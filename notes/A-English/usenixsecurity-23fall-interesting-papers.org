Researches what I am interested are as follows:

** AI-related
*** A Data-free Backdoor Injection Approach in Neural Networks
    + https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/lv
    + backdoor injection: means changing the weights of the
      original model, to obtain a new model with backdoors  
    + idea: by introduce the "substitute" dataset to achieve "data-free".
*** A Plot is Worth a Thousand Words: Model Information Stealing Attacks via Scientific Plots
+ https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/zhang-boyang
+ Task: Steal the hyper-parammters of NN models.

*** Lost at C: A User Study on the Security Implications of Large Language Model Code Assistants
+ https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/sandoval
+ The risk introduced by AI applications, here is "CODEX" and "Copilot".
*** Rethinking White-Box Watermarks on Deep Learning Models under Neural Structural Obfuscation
+ https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/yan
+ Scenario:
  + The attackers obtained the NN (which is where we call it as white-box) model first.
  + Due this model will generate data (e.g. images) with watermark,
    the attacker will try to change the model to generate data without watermark.
+ Method: too complex.
