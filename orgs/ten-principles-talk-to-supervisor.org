Every two weeks I have a chance to talk to my supervisor, with the time
of 30 minutes. I summarize the key points I recently think I should follow
with:


+ in-depth instead of in-width: not exceed two points in each meeting. Only one point with 30 minutes if necessary
+ supervisor is not a progress tracker
+ do not wrap my works, do not show good news only.
+ only confusion reported -- for seeking suggestions and guidance.
+ more painful, more effective.
+ an intermediate meeting on WeChat, if necessary.
